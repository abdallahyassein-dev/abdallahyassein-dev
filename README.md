# Hi there, I'm Abdallah Yassein ðŸ‘‹

Motivated and detail-oriented software engineer with a focus on mobile application development. Currently working as a mobile application developer using the Flutter framework, I have a strong foundation in computer science principles and am constantly learning new skills and technologies. In my previous roles, I gained hands-on experience working on several mobile application projects, developing a deep understanding of application development best practices and customer requirements. My skills include proficiency in Flutter, as well as experience working with APIs such as Google Maps and Firebase. I am a quick learner and thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments. I am eager to contribute my skills to a team that values innovation and creative problem-solving.
